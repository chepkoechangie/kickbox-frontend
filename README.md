The same company that sells us products may also be our competitor,with no desire for invention in a large market share.
We created Kick-box since we wanted give our priority to manufacturers less likely to sell directly to customers which gives us creative freedom to curate shoes we believe are more fashionable,comfortable and more importantly,durable as well.We will also offer the products at a fairer price with additional benefits to increase sales.
